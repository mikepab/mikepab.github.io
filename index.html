<h2>
  About Me
</h2>


<p><t>I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar in <a href=http://weinbergerlab.ucsf.edu>Leor Weinberger's</a> lab at the Gladstone Institute/UCSF, studying viruses with a combination of computational and experimental methods.</p>
<p>
I got my PhD from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill mentored by <a href=https://elstonlab.web.unc.edu>Timothy Elston</a> and <a href=http://hahnlab.com/>Klaus Hahn</a> developing computational tools to model and analyze biological signaling at the single-molecule level. I also frequently collaborated with our nearby neighbor <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/lewlab/people>Daniel Lew</a> at Duke University. Before then, I received my BS at Northeastern University, where I first started doing research with <a href=https://web.northeastern.edu/sunnyland/>Sunny Zhou</a> on protein post-translational modifications, and with many folks at Amgen including Dawn Cohen and Matt Potter in the Small Molecule Process and Research Development division.
