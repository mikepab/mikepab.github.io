<h2>
  About Me
</h2>


<p><t>I work as a scientist in Boston at Takeda, developing models to support the preclinical to clinical translation for rare disease and neuroscience programs. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher doing both experimental and computational work on human cytomegalovirus and SARS-CoV-2 in the <a href=http://weinbergerlab.ucsf.edu>Weinberger</a> lab at the Gladstone Institutes of Virology and UCSF. I received my PhD in chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, developing computational tools and models to study subcellular spatiotemporal coordination of signaling at the single-molecule level, mentored by <a href=https://elstonlab.web.unc.edu>Timothy Elston</a> and <a href=http://hahnlab.com/>Klaus Hahn</a>. I obtained a BS in chemistry from Northeastern University, where I did analytical protein chemistry research with <a href=https://sunnyland.sites.northeastern.edu/>Zhaohui Sunny Zhou</a> and did small molecule analytical chemistry internships with Amgen's Small Molecule Process and Product Development team, primarily working with including Dawn Cohen and Matthew Potter.
