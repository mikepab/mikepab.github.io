I use modeling and simulation to understand the dynamics of complex biological systems. I've enjoyed working on projects ranging from basic science to translational research in collaboration with a diverse range of modelers and experimentalists.

<b>As a postdoc at UCSF</b>, I am helping with the development of new classes of antiviral therapies. I have built multiscale models predicting efficacy of a new SARS-CoV-2 therapy based on clinical and laboratory data [Chaturvedi S, Vasen G, Pablo M, et al. Cell. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)01319-2)) as well as models to infer key endpoints in animal experiments. I am also using a combination of computational and experimental methods to study a key transcriptional feedback in [human cytomegalovirus](https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html), a major cause of birth defects and transplant failure.

<b>During my PhD</b>, I studied how yeast harness and filter stochastic molecular "noise" during polarity establishment, a key step in reproduction. I worked with other modelers to build biophysically-grounded PDE and agent-based models that allowed us to identify fundamental principles underlying polarization ([Pablo M et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2018](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006016), [Ramirez SA, Pablo M, et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2021](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008525)). I also worked with experimentalists to build mechanistic agent-based models that explained experimental data ([Henderston NT, Pablo M, et al. PLoS Biol 2019](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000484), [Clark-Cotton MR, Henderson NT, Pablo M, et al. Mol Biol Cell 2021](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/abs/10.1091/mbc.E21-02-0068)).

I also developed new tools to probe protein conformational changes in living cells at single molecule resolution. In collaboration with experimentalists, I developed a pipeline to analyze and cluster >1,000,000 molecular trajectories across time and space, thus extracting measurements of dynamic spatial organization and biochemical kinetics ([Liu B\*, Stone OJ\*, Pablo M\*, et al. Cell. 2021, *Equal Contribution](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)01109-0)). This pipeline leveraged hidden Markov model annotation of trajectories, Voronoi tesselation for trajectory clustering, Markov chain models for biochemical kinetics, and evolutionary algorithm and MCMC-based model optimization.
