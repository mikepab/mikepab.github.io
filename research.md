### Systems virology
I am performing computational modeling for a variety of SARS-CoV-2 projects, spanning from simulating treatments within individuals to assessing mechanisms of epidemiological spread. I am also experimentally investigating signaling networks and viral fate decisions in [cytomegalovirus](https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/index.html).

### Cellular self-organization
I used to study how the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> assembled structures called 'polarity sites', which are key to its reproduction. I worked with other modelers to build biophysically-grounded models and identify fundamental principles underlying the process of polarity establishment ([Pablo M et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2018](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006016), [Ramirez SA et al. BioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.404657v1.abstract)). I also worked with experimentalists to test whether hypothesized explanations for experimental data were biophysically plausible ([Henderston NT et al. PLoS Biol 2019](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000484), [Clark-Cotton MR et al. Mol Biol Cell 2021](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/abs/10.1091/mbc.E21-02-0068))


### Computational image analysis
I've built computational tools in collaboration with experimentalists developing new techniques for imaging. The bulk of this work has been for 'Binder/Tag', an experimental technique which improves upon fluorescent readouts for protein conformational changes, bright live-cell single particle tracking. I developed new computational tools for analyzing Binder/Tag single particle tracking data to extract biochemical and biophysical measurements (Stone, Liu, Pablo et al. In revision.)
