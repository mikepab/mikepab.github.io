I use a combination of computational and experimental methods to understand heterogeneity in complex biological systems.


<b> Currently </b>, I am studying SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the effects of new antivirals, and modeling epidemiological spread. I am also using a combination of experimental and computational approaches to study signaling circuitry responsible for viral fate decisions (i.e., latency) in [human cytomegalovirus](https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html), a major cause of birth defects and transplant failure.

<b> During my PhD </b>, I studied how 'noise' can be suppressed and leveraged for robust cellular decision making in the context of spatial and temporal coordination. The budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> assembles small subcellular structures called polarity sites key to its reproduction. I worked with other modelers to build biophysically-grounded models and identify fundamental principles underlying the process of polarity establishment ([Pablo M et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2018](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006016), [Ramirez SA et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2021](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008525)). I also worked with experimentalists to test whether hypothesized explanations for experimental data were biophysically plausible ([Henderston NT et al. PLoS Biol 2019](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000484), [Clark-Cotton MR et al. Mol Biol Cell 2021](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/abs/10.1091/mbc.E21-02-0068))

In collaboration with experimentalists, I developed new tools to probe protein conformational changes in living cells at single molecule resolution. My computational tools allowed us to extract biochemical and biophysical insights from hundreds of thousands of molecular trajectories in living cells ([Liu B*, Stone OJ*, Pablo M* et al. Cell. 2021, *Equal Contribution](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.09.026)). I have also used my experience in image analysis to help with the development of new optogenetic tools ([Elston RN*, Pablo M*, Pimenta F* et al. BioRxiv 2020, *Equal Contribution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.421990v2)).
