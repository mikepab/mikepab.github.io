I use a combination of computational and experimental methods to understand heterogeneity in complex biological systems.


<b>Currently</b>, I am studying SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the effects of a new class of antivirals (Therapeutic Interfering Particles, [Chaturvedi S, Vasen G, Pablo M, et al. Cell. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)01319-2)) and by epidemiologic modeling of viral spread. I am also using a combination of experimental and computational approaches to study viral circuitry responsible for latency in [human cytomegalovirus](https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html), a major cause of birth defects and transplant failure.

<b>During my PhD</b>, I studied how chemical and diffusional noise is suppressed and leveraged for spatiotemporally robust cellular decision making. The budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> must assemble small subcellular structures called polarity sites in order to reproduce. I worked with other modelers to build biophysically-grounded models and identify fundamental principles underlying the process of polarity establishment ([Pablo M et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2018](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006016), [Ramirez SA, Pablo M, et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2021](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008525)). I also worked with experimentalists to build quantitative biophysical and biochemical models that explained experimental data ([Henderston NT, Pablo M, et al. PLoS Biol 2019](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000484), [Clark-Cotton MR, Henderson NT, Pablo M, et al. Mol Biol Cell 2021](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/abs/10.1091/mbc.E21-02-0068))

I also developed new tools to probe protein conformational changes in living cells at single molecule resolution. In collaboration with experimentalists, my computational tools allowed us to extract biochemical and biophysical insights from hundreds of thousands of single-molecule trajectories in living cells ([Liu B\*, Stone OJ\*, Pablo M\*, et al. Cell. 2021, *Equal Contribution](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)01109-0)). I have also used my experience in image analysis to help with the development of new optogenetic tools ([Elston RN, Pablo M, Pimenta F et al. BioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.421990v2)).
