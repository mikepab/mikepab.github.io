### My philosophy
Biology is a tangled web of interactions, whether you're looking at biomolecules within a cell, or organisms within a population. I develop mathematical models, calibrate them to experimental data, and use them to quantitatively interpret and predict the behavior of biological systems. My goals are to generate new hypotheses, to test underlying assumptions, to extract quantitative parameters of interest, and to produce new understanding of the biology from first principles.

### Systems virology
I am performing computational modeling for a variety of SARS-CoV-2 projects, spanning from simulating treatments within individuals to assessing mechanisms of epidemiological spread. I am also developing experimental skills by investigating signaling networks and viral fate decisions in human [cytomegalovirus](https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/overview.html), a major cause of birth defects and transplant failure.

### Cellular self-organization
I've studied how the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> assembled structures called polarity sites, which are key to its reproduction. I worked with other modelers to build biophysically-grounded models and identify fundamental principles underlying the process of polarity establishment ([Pablo M et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2018](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006016), [Ramirez SA et al. BioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.404657v1.abstract)). I also worked with experimentalists to test whether hypothesized explanations for experimental data were biophysically plausible ([Henderston NT et al. PLoS Biol 2019](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000484), [Clark-Cotton MR et al. Mol Biol Cell 2021](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/abs/10.1091/mbc.E21-02-0068))


### Image analysis
I've built computational tools in collaboration with experimentalists developing new techniques for imaging, such as cellular protrusion/retraction ([Elston RN, Pablo M, Pimenta F et al. BioRxiv 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.421990v2)). A major focus of mine has been on an experimental technique that probes protein conformational changes in living cells at single molecule resolution. I developed new computational tools for analyzing these data, consisting of hundreds of thousands of tracks over millions of coordinates, to extract biochemical and biophysical measurements (Stone OJ, Liu B, Pablo M et al. In revision.)
