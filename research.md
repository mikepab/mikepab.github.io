<b>As a scientist at Takeda</b>, I build models to support translation from preclinical studies into the clinic. I've supported both neuroscience and rare disease programs in a variety of modalities, including gene therapy, enzyme replacement, oligonucleotides, and small molecules. I work on a range of models depending on the program's need and available data, spanning from empirical exposure-response models of preclinical animal data to QSP models integrated within nonlinear-mixed effects frameworks for clinical application.


<b>During my postdoc</b>, I worked on new classes of antiviral therapies. I built multiscale models to predict and understand efficacy of a 'therapeutic interfering particle' against SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical and laboratory data ([Chaturvedi, Vasen, Pablo, et al. Cell. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)01319-2)). I also used a combination of computational and experimental methods to study 'feedback disruptors' of human cytomegalovirus, which create an antiviral effect by interfering with viral negative feedbacks ([Chaturvedi, Pablo, et al. Cell. 2022](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00469-X)).

<b>During my PhD</b>, I studied how biological signaling networks are spatially and temporally organized at single-molecule resolution. A major part of my thesis focused on how yeast harness and filter molecular "noise" during polarity establishment, in which a patch of activated Cdc42 is created. Based on the biochemistry of Cdc42 and its regulators, I built partial differential equation and agent-based models, and identified fundamental principles underlying polarization ([Pablo M et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2018](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006016); [Ramirez SA, Pablo M, et al. PLoS Comp Biol 2021](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008525)). I also built mechanistic agent-based models that explained experimental data ([Henderston NT, Pablo M, et al. PLoS Biol 2019](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000484); [Clark-Cotton MR, Henderson NT, Pablo M, et al. Mol Biol Cell 2021](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/abs/10.1091/mbc.E21-02-0068)).

In addition to my work on yeast, I also built tools to analyze single-molecule tracking data. My colleagues developed an experimental approach to track protein conformational changes in living cells at single molecule resolution. I developed a computational pipeline to analyze millions of these trajectories across time and space, producing maps of protein activity within molecular clusters and an understanding of their dynamic regulation ([Liu\*, Stone\*, Pablo\*, et al. Cell. 2021, *Equal Contribution](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)01109-0)).
